1. What is Monoids?

String concatenation

Identity element: ""
The operation is associative: (r+s+t) = ((r + s) + t) = (r + (s + t)).

Integer addition

Identity element: 0
The operation is associative: (r+s+t) = ((r + s) + t) = (r + (s + t)).

Multiplication

Identity element: 1
The operation is associative: (r * s * t) = ((r * s) * t) = (r * (s * t)).

Boolean operator &&

Identity element: true
The operation is associative: (r && s && t) = ((r && s) && t) = (r && (s && t))

Boolean operator ||

Identity element: false
The operation is associative: (r || s || t) = ((r || s) || t) = (r || (s || t))

The laws of associativity and identity are collectively called the monoid laws. A monoid consists of the following:
1 Some type A
2 An associative binary operation, op, that takes two values of type A and com-
bines them into one: op(op(x,y), z) == op(x, op(y,z)) for any choice of x: A,
y:A,z:A
3 A value, zero: A, that is an identity for that operation: op(x, zero) == x and
op(zero, x) == x for any x: A

2. In what ways are Monoids useful?

In two ways: they facilitate parallel computation by giving us the freedom to break our problem into chunks that can be computed in parallel; and they can be composed to assemble complex calculations from simpler pieces.

3. Expressed in Scala:

trait Monoid[A] {
    def op(a1: A, a2: A): A
    val zero: A
}

val stringMonoid = new Monoid[String] { 
    def op(a1: String, a2: String) = a1 + a2 
    val zero = ""
}

List concatenation also forms a monoid:
def listMonoid[A] = new Monoid[List[A]] {
    def op(a1: List[A], a2: List[A]) = a1 ++ a2 
    val zero = Nil
}


Folding lists with monoids

def foldRight[B](z: B)(f: (A, B) => B): B def foldLeft[B](z: B)(f: (B, A) => B): B
What happens when A and B are the same type?

def foldRight(z: A)(f: (A, A) => A): A
def foldLeft(z: A)(f: (A, A) => A): A

scala> val words = List("Hic", "Est", "Index")
words: List[String] = List(Hic, Est, Index)
scala> val s = words.foldRight(stringMonoid.zero)(stringMonoid.op)
s: String = "HicEstIndex"
scala> val t = words.foldLeft(stringMonoid.zero)(stringMonoid.op)
t: String = "HicEstIndex"

We can write a general function concatenate that folds a list with a monoid:
def concatenate[A](as: List[A], m: Monoid[A]): A = as.foldLeft(m.zero)(m.op)
